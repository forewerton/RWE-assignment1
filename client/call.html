    <h1>CALL FOR PAPERS</h1>

    The 17th International Conference on Informatics and Semiotics in Organisations (ICISO) is part of a series of international events devoted to the latest research in informatics and applications of Organisational Semiotics (OS) in organisations.

    Ubiquitous Computing, Wearable Computing, Digital Business Ecosystems, Tangible User Interfaces, Intelligent Buildings, Big Data, Digital Visualization, and Social Software are some examples of how Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have permeated all aspects of individual and social life, crossing (and sometimes dissolving) the boundaries between organizations and specific places. In a society mediated by ICTs, both organisations and technology must be socially aware: mindful of the complex context in which they exist and different stakeholders live, striving for socially responsible processes and products.

    OS, with its methods and techniques, provides an effective approach for conducting practical and theoretical work in business and information systems in complex settings. OS has been considered as a discipline that enables us to understand the inter-workings and interactions between individuals and within the society, between human and technology, opening the prospect for scientific theory building and providing a handle for gaining insights of organized behaviour. The broad issues that concern the researchers in this field are philosophical, social and technical, studied using existing and newly developed semiotic theories and methods.

    <h2>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</h2>

    ICISO 2016 will continue the effort of the international research community in the development of Organisational Semiotics, focusing not only on theory-building, but also on practical benefits gained through applications of methods and techniques derived from various OS approaches. The conference theme - Socially Aware Organisations and Technologies: impact and challenges - invites us to think ahead and to explicitly consider technology and organisations from a socio-responsible perspective.
